# Pokemon React Redux example
This repository is made to give a frontend to the Pokemon-backend created by the [beanstalk workshop](https://github.com/helleroy/beanstalk-workshop).

It's based on [Redux Sample Project with 500px API](https://github.com/yildizberkay/redux-example), with a few modifications.
